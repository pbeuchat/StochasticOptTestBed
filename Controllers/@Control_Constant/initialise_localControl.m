function [flag_successfullyInitialised , flag_requestDisturbanceData] = initialise_localControl( obj , inputModelType , inputModel , vararginLocal)
% Defined for the "Control_LocalControl" class, this function will be
% called once before the simulation is started
% This function should be used to perform off-line possible
% computations so that the controller computation speed during
% simulation run-time is faster

    % You can except the "inputModel" parameter to be empty when the
    % control is specified to be "Model-Free" and non-empty otherwise
    
    % In general this "flag_requestDisturbanceData" flag should be left as
    % "false" and only set to true if access to the disturbance data is
    % required for computational speed up purposes
    flag_requestDisturbanceData = false;
    
    % When using the "Null" controller as a template, insert your code here
    % to pre-compute off-line parts of your controllers so the the "on-line
    % computation time is minimised when the "copmuteControlAction"
    % function is called at each time step
    
    % Initialise the return flag
    flag_successfullyInitialised = true;
    
    % Store the model type in the appropriate property
    obj.modelType = inputModelType;
    
    % Set the constant control value from the "vararginlocal"
